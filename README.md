## Problem Statement
As part of the challenge, we developed a chatbot that conducts in-depth passage retrieval from a given text database, providing the most pertinent passages in response to user queries. Additionally, the chatbot highlights the relevant information within the paragraph, employing language models such as BERT and clustering algorithms. Moreover, our versatile model is adaptable to fine-tuning for specific themes, enabling it to effectively answer questions tailored to different subjects.
